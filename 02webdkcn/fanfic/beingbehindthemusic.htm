<p><font face="Arial">The glorious music of the piano was echoing in the 
splendid concert hall. All the audiences were devoting in the beautiful music, 
and they were complete losing themselves in the music.<br>
The stage was decorated with translucent curtain, and the mystery musician was 
inside. The audience in the front rows might saw faint figure of green full 
dress and copper curled ponytail, yet the face of the pianist was hiding behind 
the curtain and the grand piano, with only the music he played flowing out.<br>
Some people said that the mystery pianist must be an Adonis; while some other 
people believed that the beauty must be in fact a gorgeous lady dressing man's 
dress. However, nobody really cared about that though they were curious about 
it, since all the audience were too devoting in the music. It was the 
intoxicating music that processing them, and the musician behind the music might 
not really that drawing their attention.<br>
Yet there was one man who acted different. The silver-haired man seemed calm and 
indifferent. He was like enjoying the music just as what all the others were 
doing, yet an unusual thoughtful sense was deep in the pair of silver eyes.<br>
When the song ended Zoisite went back to the backstage after answering a curtain 
call. He was confused as he saw the silver-haired man waiting there. The man's 
voice was calm and low:&quot;Such an uninhibited music should not be sealed in the 
cage however magnificent the cage was. And what on earth the cage was from which 
your music is trying to escape?&quot;<br>
The emerald eyes widened. The expression on the delicate face of the boy was 
kind of arrogant and biting, but when hearing the older one's words a warm smile 
appeared on his delicate face. He reached out to shake hands with the man in 
front of him:&quot;You are like reading my mind, sir. You are my soul mate, my name 
is Zoisite.&quot;<br>
The ice in the silver eyes melted, and the icy expression softened. The man held 
the pale, slender hand with his own strong one and answered:&quot;Call me Kunzite.”<br>
