<p><font face="Arial">He is an everyman, he was an everyman, until he was drawn into an 
extraordinary event.<br>
<br>
He enjoyed his childhood in his hometown.<br>
<br>
In where he once lived, the sky was always crystal blue; in where he was born, 
the mountains and the streams were always graceful and pure. He loved his 
hometown.<br>
<br>
But what impressed him most was the legend passing on in his hometown. It was a 
legend about the moon.<br>
<br>
People who were telling the legend believed that after the death of a moral, the 
soul of the dead one would fly to the moon, which is the heaven full of 
happiness and harmony.<br>
<br>
He loved the legend, as everyone else did.<br>
<br>
When the curtain of night fell, he often sit on the soft grassland holding his 
knees staring at the moon, and imagine the days and nights of his passed-away 
families and friends in the paradise. He never felt sad, since he knew those 
people had simply moved to a new home, to which he would move one day in the 
future. These thoughts made him smile, and he waited for another day to meet in 
the paradise, he waited patiently in the dream.<br>
<br>
Time flies with one after another nights shined by the moonlight. He grew up, he 
was far from his childhood, and far from his hometown.<br>
<br>
He didn't reach the moon, instead he reached Elysium, the flourishing capital 
with numerous changes for high-classed lives according to people. There he would 
be able to gain fame, to gain better life, which his lovely but barren hometown 
could never offer.<br>
<br>
After all he could not wear the crystal blue sky as clothes; he could not have 
the beautiful grassland as meals, nor could he keep the pure, graceful 
landscapes as money and wealth.<br>
<br>
People kept the common sense. Before he had wandered for too long in Elysium had 
he found a job, so he became a soldier of the royal palace.<br>
<br>
His salary was no more than enough, nor did his work tougher than acceptable. 
Every day he worked hard, every month he gained his salary, and he was living an 
honest life. The only pity was that he seldom had friends, people with higher 
class looked down upon him, same as his looking upon those with lower class.<br>
<br>
Fortunately he had fellow-villagers among the soldiers. During off-hour they 
gathered and made small talks.<br>
<br>
Once he mentioned the old legend about the moon, and the little boy staring at 
the moon for nights.<br>
<br>
But he received nothing but laughter, they laughed at him as if he was a 
three-year-old idiot, before told him that someone had already lived on the 
moon. Legends were legends, and no one would believe in them except a na&iuml;ve 
idiot like him.<br>
<br>
The settlers on the moon, who was known as the lunarians, had built the palace 
named Millennium. However they were not born on the moon, instead, they were 
long-lived creatures who owned the sacred silver crystal from the depth of the 
space.<br>
<br>
He cursed them because of fury, although he had also dimly heard about the 
lunarians that he was unwilling to admit. He was stubborn that would not 
believer in things that he had never seen with his own eyes.<br>
<br>
Yet it didn't contradict with his believing in that legend.<br>
<br>
However, the truth would finally come true. Coincidently he got a chance to go 
visit the moon.<br>
<br>
It was on the day for celebrating the grown-up of the moon princess. The prince 
of the earth was invited, and the king ordered some soldiers as well as the 
guardians to follow the prince in order to protect him.<br>
<br>
He was included.<br>
<br>
They stepped on the grand way which was glittering being too wide and empty for 
them. In the front of the terrain visitors five young lads are talking about 
something beyond his understanding. He could identify the one with short, dark 
hair as their prince, and they were following for his safety. However he could 
even not gather his attention.<br>
<br>
Again he remembered the old legend, in which the moon was the paradise full of 
happiness and peace, the paradise for the death.<br>
<br>
The way between the moon and the earth was usually closed. Because of either 
pride or prudence the lunarians seldom contacted with the earthlings, from the 
beginning to the present.<br>
<br>
Well, the fellows was not lying, there were settlers on the moon. He knew the 
truth, but still unwilling to give up the dream grew from his childhood.<br>
<br>
He walked thinking, and his breath was like being taken. Sweat wetted his hands 
as if he was on the pilgrimage.<br>
<br>
When he stepped onto the moon he felt himself on the solid ground. He stung 
himself to make sure that he was not in a dream.<br>
<br>
He narrowed his eyes observing the lunarians, he saw many people but without a 
single one familiar.<br>
<br>
He didn't find his dead families or friends, nor did he find anyone of his dead 
neibourhoods.<br>
<br>
Preposterous. It was he who was still alive stepping on the ground of the moon 
instead of those passed-away people.<br>
<br>
He felt something breaking down inside him. He knew it was his soul, his dream 
lasted through his whole childhood.<br>
<br>
He felt his anger and hatred towards the lunarians, for their having stolen the 
moon.<br>
<br>
The Millennium stole the sacred paradise in his dream of hometown.<br>
<br>
He wanted to take the revenge, if only he dared, for disobeying the king would 
be a disaster to him.<br>
<br>
Until one certain day.<br>
<br>
He could never remember how long it had been since he was back from the moon, 
the only thing in his memory was the unusual atmosphere in the palace.<br>
<br>
A faint voice spoke to him, and then the voice became clearer and clearer. He 
had just turned over one's duty so he allowed his curiosity to take him to the 
voice.<br>
<br>
It was red-haired lady speaking waving her sword and shield. The crowded of 
soldiers echoed her every sentence. He tried he best but it was still too noisy 
for him to catch her words.<br>
<br>
Except her last words.<br>
<br>
She said, attack the moon.<br>
<br>
He was taken aback. Before he got back his mind the lady led her army flooded to 
the glittering way leading to the moon. He was pushed by the exciting people, 
and could even hardly keep himself standing.<br>
<br>
¡ªAttack, attack the moon, for the paradise once belonged to us.<br>
<br>
A voice echoed in his soul, leading him to lift his shield and sword.<br>
<br>
¡ªKill the lunarians, and the slaughter would give the pure paradise back to us.<br>
<br>
The voice continued, leading him to move¡­<br>
<br>
His blood was like burning, and he was taken by the nerve filled with 
excitement. He began to believe that he was a warrior, who would fight for 
belief, fight for dream, fight for his hometown, fight for his families and 
friends. And if he died, he would die fighting with hornor.<br>
<br>
No longer hesitating, he joined the lady, marched towards Millennium waving his 
sword.<br>
<br>
¡­<br>
<br>
At the end of the battle, when the deadly cold white light of the silver crystal 
was swallowing the whole space, he came to an end as everyone else did. A the 
moment he was embracing the death, he saw the moon which had shined his dream, 
purely, gracefully¡­<br>
<br>
That was the paradise, that was his paradise. With never lunarians, never the 
palace of Millennium, but only with his families, his friends and his 
neighborhoods, who were welcoming him warmly.<br>
<br>
That was the paradise¡­<br>
<br>
He closed his eyes being satisfied, and the last smile appeared on his lips, 
like the brightest light at that moment.<br>
