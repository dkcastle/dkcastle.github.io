<p><font face="Arial">Sakura petals floated, sakura petals fell, sakura petals 
covered the ground. Sakura rained piece after piece, as if burying the whole 
world in a faint rosy dream.<br>
&quot;My last wish is¡­to die beautifully.&quot;<br>
One piece.<br>
&quot;Am I pretty, Kunzite-sama?&quot;<br>
Two pieces.<br>
&quot;I loved you, Kunzite-sama¡­&quot;<br>
Three piece.<br>
The silver-haired man held the copper-ponytailed boy closer, as if he has a lot 
to say, as if what he wanted to say were even more than all the words he had 
said since he was born.<br>
However, he only murmured at last, with his voice as slight as a whisper.<br>
&quot;Zoisite¡­&quot;<br>
The deep voice was like a thin piece of ice, cold and clear, too fragile to face 
even a lightest touch.<br>
Yet, when his sigh was caressing the pretty face of Zoisite as soft as a 
feather, he saw the boy opened his emerald eyes.<br>
It was all in a sudden that the silver-eyed man was completely shocked. Before 
he could react, a slender pale hand touched his handsome face.<br>
&quot;I was still alive, Kunzite-sama! I was joking just now.&quot;<br>
With these words, a graceful, charming smile appeared on that delicate face, on 
which there was still tears.<br>
Kunzite tightly held his recovered lover. He had something to express, but his 
throat was too dry to let out a single syllable. As a result, he kissed his 
lover instead.<br>
The silver-haired tennou gently held the rosy lips which were so familiar to him 
with his own. The fragrant of the rose tasted so sweet, that he was completely 
drown into the charming and gentle react of the younger one.<br>
However something must be wrong.<br>
The weird feeling was dim and faint, but it was there.<br>
Unexplainably the soul of the man shivered.<br>
NO!<br>
Kunzite felt his heart filled with horror, which haunted him like sea serpents. 
His kiss became more and more thirsty. Zoisite's pale hands slowly approached 
his lover's first button, which was usually unbuttoned, before caressed the 
older man's collarbone, as if he was encouraged by the passion of his beloved 
mentor. <br>
The silver-haired man lost all his patience when being touched like that. He 
didn't even bothered using magic, instead, he tore the pretty boy's suit 
directly.<br>
Kunzite was awakened by a flood of white light flashed through his mind.<br>
No rosy fragrance at all, he was completely alone. He was rounded by nothing but 
only the deep, thick darkness, which made the air stagnant. And all he had 
experienced just now were no more than a dream.<br>
Yet he bed was a mess, not to mention there was still sense of lewdness in the 
air. All these were forcing him to remember how vivid his dream was.<br>
He could see the smile on the delicate face of the boy in his dream on the bed 
table. However, he was clear that however he stared and called, the photo would 
not response, even if a single sight, or simply an expression.<br>
And all Kunzite could do was to seal the sweet dream in his deepest heart. 
Hence, when he appeared in front of anyone of the Dark Kingdom, the others would 
only see a cold, powerful and merciless ice king¡ªKunzite¡ªas usual.<br>
Kunzite was checking the documents on the desk sitting in his office, while 
listening Jadeite's mission report at the same moment. Jadeite was carrying a 
pile of documents and a thick notebook speaking something seriously, Kunzite 
seemed to be carefully with his stony expression perfectly wearing on his face.<br>
However, he had in fact no idea about what exactly the blond was talking about.<br>
The silver sights had stayed on the white-skinned face for quite a time, and 
Kunzite was a little lost in his thought.<br>
The dream he had last night was still vivid in mind, and the figure of the blond 
in front of him was like fading. He was so alike to Zoisite his beloved boy, and 
their shadows slowly and faintly superposed each other.<br>
Not long ago Nephrite and Zoisite had dead one after another. The brain-washing 
of the new general Endymion was not as effective as expected. He could hardly 
finish any missions successfully except on the bed of Her Majesty. <br>
And that was why Beryl released Jadeite, who was the former King of Illusion, 
from the eternal sleep with anger.<br>
However¡­<br>
&quot;Kunzite, take your youma with you. He is yours from now on.&quot;<br>
Jadeite was shocked:&quot;But, Queen Beryl-sama¡­&quot;<br>
&quot;No question!&quot; Beryl's sharp voice broke through the air mercilessly, &quot;Jadeite, 
I am so merciful that I liberated you from the eternal sleep, but it doesn't 
mean your mistakes in the past are forgiven! Listen, if only you succeed as 
Kunzite's youma could you back to your place as the king of Illusion; failure 
would lead both your body and your soul to dirt, and you will completely 
disappear from the universe! Clear?&quot;<br>
Bang!<br>
It was the truncheon with a black crystal ball on the top knocking on the floor 
heavily.<br>
&quot;¡­as you wish, Queen Beryl-sama.&quot;<br>
A dim memory bothered Jadeite that he thought he was about to say something at 
the moment he was frozen, but he could not figure out what exactly it was. All 
he could do was to bent timidly, followed the silver-haired man submissively, 
got use to his new identity as a common youma.<br>
As soon as youma Jadeite finished the first part of the first point of the first 
main point of his report had he found Kunzite staring at him with those silver 
sights almost froze.<br>
&quot;Kunzite-sama? Are you¡­what are you thinking?&quot; Jadeite asked unsurely after a 
few seconds' hesitate.<br>
Kunzite was suddenly pushed back to reality. No sooner than he heard Jadeite had 
he noticed his thoughts wandering. He moved back his sights from the younger one 
without leaving a trace, before he asked back coolly:&quot;Anything of your 
business?&quot;<br>
Jadeite was taken aback, for a while he didn't know what he could say as an 
answer.<br>
&quot;I have something else to deal with, leave the rest of your report to tomorrow.&quot; 
Kunzite ordered before Jadeite thought out an answer.<br>
Although taken aback by the stony, cold voice, Jadeite answered straightly:&quot;Hai, 
Kunzite-sama.&quot; And then he stepped out of Kunzite's office still submissively.<br>
He saw Kunzite buried his face in his both hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jadeite couldn't help feel worried about the highest-ranked tennou. <br>
When he was still the king of Illusion, he found Kunzite was not that arrogant 
and unapproachable as what was spreading among the youma, though the 
silver-haired man was icy cold. And during working he was more devoting than 
anyone, they both were. As a result, They had always cooperated well.<br>
Even in the period in which the former king of illusion was set as Kunzite's 
youma as a punishment to the younger one had Jadeite to admit that his lord 
treated his well that he had helped him a lot. The reason might be they were the 
only two left among the for generals, but it was not important. Whatever, 
thought Jadeite, he had to do something for Kunzite-sama since he was nice to 
him, he didn't knew what he could do at all, though.<br>
For the whole day, Kunzite kept himself in his bedroom. Fortunately he wasn't 
summoned by the queen, nor did he summoned any youma, including Jadeite, to whom 
he had given a special treatment.<br>
In the evening, Jadeite finally made the decision to see what on earth happened, 
and what was more important, what he could do for the tennou, who appeared weird 
that day.<br>
Kunzite's bedroom was not locked, closed, though.<br>
When stealthily opened the door a little, Jadeite could not believe in what he 
saw.<br>
Kunzite, who was well-known as the icy king for not only the color of his hair 
but also his perfect self-control, was drinking hard drink one glass after 
another, as if he were a decadent alcoholic. Several empty bottles was on the 
table out of order, and wet glass fragments were on the floor.<br>
The situation was too unusual for Jadeite to remember who he was. He rushed into 
the room even without any thought:&quot;Kunzite-sama, you¡­you cannot¡­&quot;<br>
He was stuck before he could finish a sentence. The FORMOR king of illusion 
suddenly remembered his own awful situation.<br>
Yet beyond the imagination of Jadeite, Kunzite didn't drive him away, or even 
crueler, throw him into chaos, like what he had done to the low-level youma who 
had offended him.<br>
&quot;Is that Jadeite? Come in and have some drink. After all, we are the only two 
alive among all we four.&quot;<br>
With these words Kunzite raised his head and gave a glimpse to the younger 
standing in front of him carelessly. The his surprise, Jadeite felt a sense of 
faint smile appeared at the lips of the highest-ranked tennou, and his hoarse 
voice sounded filled with bitter.<br>
Jadeite at first thought maybe he'd better find an excuse to escape since he was 
not good at drinking at all. However, when he might those icy silver eyes, he 
noticed that they seemed to be a little red and swollen. Did he cry? In the 
shadow out of anyone's sight? Jadeite began to wonder whether he had saw the 
deepest pain sealed under the coldest ice, and it was like a flame burning in 
the deepest heart of a glacier.<br>
Jadeite's heart was softened. Before thinking twice he sat down next to Kunzite, 
picked up the wine bottle on the table before poured a glass of wine for 
himself, and then he rose the glass:&quot;Bottom up¡­for¡­whatever!&quot;<br>
As they drank one glass after another, Jadeite forgot how much wine he had had. 
All he could felt was the pain in his head. He was top-heavy, and his head was 
like exploding. He also felt bad in his throat, as if a red soldering iron was 
burning inside.<br>
Finally he failed to support his own body and fell down.<br>
At the moment he felt into unconsciousness Jadeite felt himself leaning against 
something strong and warm.<br>
Kunzite at last lost control to himself when a unconscious blond boy falling 
into his arms. He dropped the crystal glass on the floor without care about how 
valuable it was, and then the comely young man was pushed down onto the bed 
violently.<br>
Jadeite opened his eyes unconsciously, and Kunzite suddenly froze when he 
noticed that pair of sky-blue eyes.<br>
Another glass was swept down to the floor and broke. Kunzite grabbed Jadeite, 
who had lost all his strength, and turned the younger one around before covered 
Jadeite's body with his own again.<br>
Kunzite lifted the younger one's jacket, and caressed the pale shoulder and back 
carefully, as if he was admiring a delicate piece of art. Then he pressed his 
face close to the back of Jadeite while whispering faintly¡­<br>
&quot;My Zoisite¡­&quot;<br>
Perhaps Jadeite didn't hear that at all. Or perhaps, even if he heard that 
couldn't he understand the complex meaning of such a word, considering his 
almost unconsciousness. All he could noticed in the mind was, he could feel a 
pair of warm hands trembling while caressing every inch of his back. Kunzite 
kept touching the soft, smooth skin tenderly with passion, and called his love's 
name.<br>
How long had it been since Zoisite was killed, and how long had it been since he 
lost that slender beauty? The answer to the question was hiding in his waking 
arousal, and now the answer was coming clearer and clearer.<br>
&quot;Zoisite¡­Zoisite¡­&quot;<br>
He covered Jadeite's back with kisses. First as slight and gentle as the wings 
of butterflies, but soon they became hungry and rough.<br>
Kunzite was hardened, and when feeling the blond shivering the burning part 
between his legs became even harder. <br>
Jadeite's sense of lavender pervaded the air, as if was trying to notice the 
silver-haired ice king that the playing porn was completely an opera of the 
absurd.<br>
Yet it was useless at all.<br>
The delicate, spoiled rose was too deep in his mind, the rose whose throne had 
been already plunged deep in his heart. The fragrance of the rose was so thick 
and passionate that all the uncommon feelings were covered.<br>
Something seemed to be wrong¡­but so what?<br>
Gently and softly Kunzite kissed the soft, smooth skin of the other man. He 
licked his neck and shoulder, trailed his tongue down along his mate's back, and 
then stopped at the pants line.<br>
It was a whole new feeling to Jadeite. He felt himself brought to a world in 
which he was completely a stranger. It was a kind of exciting mixed with 
pleasure, but when he tried to gather his attention to sense what he felt, such 
feeling seemed to faint, abandoning him in an empty world.<br>
Could alcohol bring him so magical an experience? Jadeite was too drunk to think 
about it. <br>
It was like a toxic dream to Jadeite, and the dream itself was like toxic 
papaver. If it were a dream, the blond was willing to let himself float in the 
unique pleasure, and lost in the dream, never wake up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jadeite trembled as a pair of warm hands caressed his butts before a few strong 
fingers slightly pressing his entrance. Then several strong fingers started to 
try his entrance.<br>
Kunzite's patience was burning out. He took off all his clothes, and then do the 
same thing to the blond. As what he saw, the younger one was as slender as 
Zosite, as pale as Zoisite, and even as sensitive as Zoisite.<br>
And the most important thing was, he was still alive. <br>
Kunzite strung one of his fingers into Jadeite while at the same time rubbed the 
manhood of the younger one. The arousal of the blond was already half-awakened 
because of Kunzite's caress, but that was not enough. <br>
When feeling the part in his hands slowly expanding, Kunzite began to add a 
second finger into the blond. Jadeite arched his back as the sudden challenge, 
yet before he understood what was happening Kunzite's third finger was already 
in.<br>
The ice king explored the warm, wet cave with patience and care. His fingernail 
swept slightly against what was sucking his fingers, groping for further and 
deeper.<br>
&quot;Ah--&quot;<br>
Jadeite couldn't help screamed when a wave of pleasure attacked him in a sudden, 
he was still feeling like in the dream, though. <br>
Kunzite knew that he had found the point. <br>
He immediately pulled his fingers out, and before the younger one could response 
to the sudden loss, he quickly rubbed his own arousal and took the place of the 
fingers with his hard and burning weapon. Then he began to trust, playing his 
own melody on the blond, as one of his hands was taking care of the member 
suffering spasm of his mate playing a chorus for his solo dance in a same 
rhythm.<br>
&quot;Hmmm¡­no, Errrr¡­Ahhhh¡­&quot;<br>
Tears appeared at the blond's eye-corners and top of his now completely hardened 
length. <br>
Kunzite swept the pre-cum, toyed with the weak point of the younger one, and 
trusted faster and harder. He hit the point again and again, caused the other 
man's continuous shiver.<br>
&quot;¡­Ahhhhh¡ªAhhhh!&quot;<br>
Finally Jadeite exploded in Kunzite's hand, no sooner than he release he fell 
completely into darkness. And Kunzite, after a few more thrusts, exploded inside 
the blond.<br>
The warm liquid soon cooled down in Kunzite's hands. He stared at that white, 
sticky load of the former king of illusion, and licked his hand slowly and 
devotionally.<br>
Kunzite swallowed while narrowed his silver eyes. All faded, as if all were 
fake. The only thing that was left vivid was the taste of that liquid created by 
Jadeite...no, by Zoisite.<br>
He should be Zoisite, so he was Zoisite. Rose might have the smell of lavender, 
but rose was still rose. With these thoughts, Kunzite held the young blond who 
was asleep with his eyes closed in his arms and fell asleep.<br>
In the next morning, when Jadeite came back to himself he couldn't help moaned. 
The pain in his head because of hangover was mixed with the one at his back 
part. The feeling was even worse than the pain caused by the planes when he was 
woke up from the eternal sleep.<br>
When opening his eyes suffering from the sharp pain in a trance, it took Jadeite 
a while to notice that he was not on his own bed and not in his own room either.<br>
Holy shit!<br>
Looking around timidly, Jadeite could not believe what he had seen. Again he 
closed his eyes and prayed everything around him was nothing but a nightmare, 
yet that was completely useless. The pains all over his body, especially at his 
back between his butts, were keeping notice him with the cruel reality.<br>
Kunzite was standing with icy calmness besides the bed with his arms folding at 
the front, expressionlessly staring at his youma who was slumping on his bed. He 
was already dressed¡ªthe uniform of the Dark Kingdom was on him completely.<br>
And there was no sign of what happened last night on that icy cold face. Not 
even a sense.<br>
Jadeite felt awkward under the scan, so he turned a little to another side. He 
though that he should at least get up and put on his clothes, but when he made 
up his mind to act, he found that even more difficult to him than being scanned 
lying on the bed. Not only because of the backache, headache, bonesache and the 
mess between his legs as well as inside him; but also because he was afraid to 
expose such a mess to that pair of silver sights, although he didn't know why.<br>
The young man shivered, wrapped himself tighter with the quilt.<br>
The atmosphere was so silent that was like solidifying, and in the end it was 
Kunzite who broke the silence:&quot;I will be responsible for what I had done. See me 
in my office when you made your decision.&quot;<br>
With these words the silver-haired man turned back and went outside, leaving 
only Jadeite, who was frozen by his cold voice, being wrapped in the quilt on 
the bed at a loss.<br>
When the former king of Illusion finally had some ideas about what Kunzite had 
said and what had happened last night, the criminal who had made him feel like 
hell presently had already disappeared, and he was the only one left in the 
room.<br>
For a few minutes, it was a blank in Jadeite's mind. However, eventually, he was 
able to gather some strength to walk haltingly to the bathroom, cleaned himself 
from inside to outside. Then he put on his clothes, and left without a word.<br>
In the following days, Jadeite tried his best to avoid to meet his new 
commander, except for work reporting. And even when reporting to the older man 
he gave up his usual extremely detailed style, in order to shorten the time he 
has to face Kunzite.<br>
Jadeite's report was almost as simple as telegraph; hence Kunzite could not miss 
the uncommon situation of the blond.<br>
In fact, Jadeite kept his timid and respect to Kunzite. At the same time, he was 
still serious enough to his work though he had shortened his report. However, 
the abnormity was too obvious for even a low-leveled youma to notice.<br>
The heavy mood in which Jadeite was made Kunzite a little uneasy. Every time he 
saw the younger man he felt as if there were a pair of eyes staring at his back. 
Yet he could not grasp the faint sights, and the eyes were one moment as blue as 
Jadeite's, but one moment turned to emerald, which was so familiar to him.<br>
Kunzite's temper became worse and worse because of the unsolved problem. 
Eventually, he lost his calmness, which once made him the ice king of the 
kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One day as soon as Jadeite finished his routine report Kunzite prevented him 
from living in a freezing voice: &quot;I don't think it a good idea to let the thing 
happened last time keep unsolved. Deal with it as soon as possible, it is for 
both our good.&quot;<br>
Jadeite was taken aback. He paused for a while, and showed only respect and 
innocence in his expression when answering: &quot;Please forgive me being too foolish 
to understand, Lord Kunzite. What are you talking about? Whatever it is I will 
obey your order.&quot;<br>
Kunzite was used to be proud of his patience, but hearing such words he 
completely lost it at last.<br>
&quot;Jadeite! Never try to fool me! You are challenging my intellect if you want me 
to believe that YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!&quot;<br>
&quot;Your wish is my command, Kunzite-sama. &quot; Jadeite kept his compliance, &quot;Let it 
pass if you hope so, I am your youma and nothing else had ever happened.&quot;<br>
The words are tame and soft, but Kunzite was so furious that he felt challenged.<br>
At last the ice king suddenly pressed on towards the other man while started in 
a low voice: &quot;What happened is happened, Jadeite. I hope you are not so na?ve 
that trying to pretend that nothing had happened. Hand out your price, and let 
it to an end as soon as possible.&quot;<br>
&quot;Please¡­forgive me, Kunzite-sama. I mean no offense, nor do I have 
any¡­ambition¡­not at all. Hence, I will never ask for more than my due.&quot;<br>
Kunzite was completely infuriate by Jadeite's words. He grabbed the younger 
one's collar and transported with him in his hand. Jadeite was frightened when 
he saw where they had reached. The memory of that morning which was filled with 
shame and pain flashed through his mind, and made him shivered.<br>
After a moment's hesitate Jadeite eventually started: &quot;I could understand 
that¡­your feeling about¡­about what happened to Zoisite, Kunzite-sama. But¡­but 
please¡­&quot;<br>
&quot;Enough, Jadeite!&quot; before Jadeite could finish a complete sentence he was 
interrupted by Kunzite, who was at the edge of madness, &quot;It's none of your 
business, it's more valuable for you to tell me what you ask for than to gossip 
the matter of Zoisite!&quot;<br>
Kunzite ran out of intellect with the roar full of fury. The silver eyes 
suddenly darkened, and a sense of icy coldness flashed through them. The poor 
blonde was almost trembling in the freezing sights.<br>
&quot;If you are too reserved to even price yourself, I do not mind helping you with 
some unique ways.&quot; Kunzite's voice was even colder than usually, and the deep 
tone was a sign of danger.<br>
Before Jadeite could react Kunzite immediately practiced his &quot;unique ways&quot;.<br>
Jadeite fell down onto the bed heavily. Unless the soft, expansive mattress his 
teeth would all be knocked off. He tried his best to fight against the monarch 
suppressing him from the back, but that hand holding his both hands together was 
far overpowered. Jadeite fought to escape from the control, yet he failed in the 
end.<br>
Last time the silver-haired man do the familiar thing to him was like a 
intoxicating dream, and in the dream the ice king played his melody on Jadeite 
calling Zoisite's name. But this time, Jadeite felt the sharp pain flooding to 
him, as if he were being torn, being pierced, and being destroyed.<br>
It felt like a blade stabbing inside him, and the huge, hard sword was plunging 
and burning. At first Jadeite tried to bite the quilt to prevent himself from 
crying, but soon he gave up to the sharp, violent pain and let a meaningless cry 
escape from his throat.<br>
&quot;Ah¡­AHHHHH!&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Kunzite slowed down assaulting and asked, before he heard 
any answer he trusted with almost his full strength adding:&quot;What is your price?&quot;<br>
Jadeite was deeply hurt by the second question, yet even if he were not wasn't 
he able to answer since his breathe was almost completely taken by the burning 
pain from the back. It was too different from the first time he had 
experienced¡­he was not prepared at all, and even if he were, he didn't think he 
could survive the torture given by the highest-ranked tennou.<br>
&quot;You are still not responding to me, are you?&quot; A cold voice strung into the 
blond's mind, and the tone of Kunzite was as stony hard as his manhood, which 
was throbbing like a tyrant in his entrance.<br>
Tears escaped the younger one's eyes, he gathered all his strength to murmur in 
a hoarse voice: &quot;Lord¡­Kunzite¡­please¡­I don't mean to¡­I don't¡­please leave 
me¡­alone¡­&quot; His voice was like fragments of falling leaves floating in the cold 
air, and eventually fell to dirt.<br>
But Kunzite kept merciless, and continue fucking the poor blond senselessly. 
With the fierce lancing Kunzite suddenly grabbed the golden hair and pushed it 
crazily, as if he wanted to tear it off from the younger man.<br>
&quot;Is that enough?&quot; Kunzite raged in a low voice, at the same time he didn't stop 
his assaulting, &quot;Is that enough for you to answer my question?&quot;<br>
Jadeite knew he must have heard some words, but he could not identify what he 
heard. The pain was like fading, as well as his consciousness fading at the same 
time. He felt like a boat floating on the ocean in the storm, and all he could 
do was to close his eyes giving up himself to the fury of the sea wave. <br>
The length of the blond raised its head hopelessly as his prostate was heavily 
hit again and again. Tears flew from the top of that despairing hardened member, 
but neither of the two had noticed that. Kunzite was paying all his attention to 
force Jadeite to answer his question, while Jadeite had already in a coma.<br>
It felt so cold, almost freezing.<br>
Both Jadeite's body and his soul were shivering in the coldness. He felt warm 
liquid from his entrance flowing through his legs. He thought it might be 
blood¡­or not only blood but also something more.<br>
Jadeite lost himself in pain, and was awakened in a more intense pain. Mixed in 
the pain there was a weird feeling of pleasure, but such pleasure only brought 
him shame and desperation. The silver-haired man was still lancing, his weapon 
was still hard and huge, and even hotter¡­or at least, Jadeite felt it hotter, 
since he was suffering a loss of heat. <br>
The pleasure felt weird to Jadeite. It was familiar, or at least, it felt 
familiar. However, Jadeite could not sense the feeling of satisfied this time. 
All brushing his mind was the feeling of shame and desperation brought by the 
unexpected pleasure.<br>
Like a dry leaf in winter, Jadeite felt himself pierced into pieces, swept by 
the wind of pain and pleasure, fell into the empty black hole.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kunzite did not want to be a murderer. As a result, when he found the young man 
beneath him had lost consciousness, he noticed that he might have gone too far, 
not to mention the unusual coldness of Jadeite's body and the blood watering the 
sheet.<br>
Finally he stopped torturing the younger man, who was already black and blue. He 
used a few healing magic on Jadeite, and lay him on the bed at a convenient 
position. Before left for his endless work Kunzite didn't forgot to cover 
Jadeite with quilt.<br>
The silver-haired tennou was just on time when he was back to bedroom after 
finishing his work. His prisoner had just waked up, and was glancing around 
blankly.<br>
However such blank didn't last long. As soon as Kunzite appeared visible to 
Jadeite, the golden-haired youma felt as if all his wounds were back to lives, 
although Kunzite had already healed them before. Jadeite was not able to point 
out whether the sharp pain was truly insisting, or was simply his illusion that 
was torturing him in his mind.<br>
It was to escape that was his first thought, yet he was frozen by the icy cool 
sight from those silver eyes. He lost control to his body, and was not able to 
move for even a single inch. He was about to say something, but simply kept 
quiet with his mouth half-opened.<br>
&quot;What is your price, you'd better show it clearly for your own good. A deal is a 
deal.&quot;<br>
The ice king kept his expressionless face stony cool calmly, as if he were 
simply talking about the weather. Yet Jadeite trembled again in the coldness he 
felt. The blonde sat up and lowered his eyes, hoping that the silver-haired 
general would not seen the tears gathering in his eyes. At the moment, he kept 
trying to explain with his usual timid tone:&quot;Please¡­please trust me, 
Kunzite-sama. I promise¡­promise that I ask for nothing, and no blackmail, never. 
Please¡­&quot;<br>
The icy pale eyes narrowed.<br>
Kunzite had understood too well that his docile youma would certainly keep his 
words. Being the leader of the shitennou, he knew well about Jadeite as well as 
about Nephrite. Moreover, when Jadeite was still the tennou of illusion, they 
had once cooperated very well, not to mention the profound friendship between 
them.<br>
However, it was the secret feeling of guilty that drove Kunzite to the edge. He 
had never thought himself a ruffian, it was alcohol and the dream in the night 
before that made him a rapist. He had to prove himself not a criminal by making 
up his mistake to Jadeite, in order to make himself feel better. Yet he was 
presently furious about the action of the blonde.<br>
Jadeite's voice lowered as he sense the fury of that glacier. He had no idea 
about what to say, the only thing he was sure was that whatever he said, the 
answer would be some torture even crueler than eternal sleep¡­Or perhaps, if he 
were lucky enough, Kunzite-sama might be so kind-hearted that simply throw him 
into chaos.<br>
Hence, the blonde young man calmed down after a moment's hesitate. He gathered 
all his courage to meet the silver sights, from which he had tried to escape 
before: &quot;If you insist, Kunzite-sama, I have one wish¡ªIf allowed, I hope you let 
it pass, and never mention it anymore.&quot;<br>
The only thing he received as an answer was silence. Kunzite's expressionless 
face was like a stagnated sculpture.<br>
Jadeite felt his courage frozen and broken into pieces, while his head lowered 
again.<br>
So¡­chaos?<br>
It might not be a bad thing, thought Jadeite, at least better than the situation 
he was presently in.<br>
To his surprise, after the silence felt as long as a dozen of centuries, Jadeite 
didn't have to face the fury he had expected. Instead, Kunzite answered in a 
tender¡ªeven fond, if ignoring the coldness in the tone¡ªvoice:&quot;If you ask for 
that, Jadeite, I will keep my words.&quot; He paused before added: &quot;Report your work 
to Bandana from now on, she is under my command.&quot;<br>
As soon as he finished, Kunzite turned back and left, with his pale cape 
floating for an instance at the door. Jadeite was alone again, as if nothing had 
happen.<br>
Jadeite didn't see Kunzite anymore from that day. It seemed that his former 
comrade as well as present master was avoiding him. Oniwa Bandana collected all 
his work reports, and gave him the reviews from Kunzite.<br>
Kunzite was like concealing himself in an iceberg. When Zoisite was alive, he 
would smile gently and fondly to that beautiful boy; and after Zoisite's death, 
he had occasionally speak highly of his youma or shown his disdain to Endymion, 
who was the new bed toy of Queen Beryl. But now, the only expression left on his 
face was expressionless coldness.<br>
However, such situation didn't last long.<br>
Before long, the sailor senshi who were always claiming themselves as the 
mouthpiece of love and justice found the entrance to the Dark Kingdom at D point 
in North Polar. Eventually, they appeared at Dark Kingdom bringing the silver 
crystal, which had once destroyed the earth and the moon during the previous 
life.<br>
In the battle, when being surrounded by five girls Jadeite suddenly remembered 
what he was about to tell the queen just before being frozen by Her Majesty¡ªHe 
was wanting to speak out the human identity of Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury and 
Sailor Mars.<br>
Yet, obviously all these were meaningless at the moment.<br>
Jadeite saw soap bubbles, fire, thunder and light aiming at him at the same 
time. He thought he would die, immediately. Death is not a bad thing, he 
thought, after all it was not his first time to die, and at least he had never 
betrayed his kingdom. Perhaps he would see his workmate Nephrite as well as his 
friend Zoisite in the world after death. Or even more, if he saw Kunzite as 
well, they might finally have a chance to explain everything to each other, so 
that they would become friends again.<br>
Well, Kunzite-sama is so powerful that it might take him centuries even 
thousands of decades to meet him in the other world? Jadeite laughed at himself 
quietly in his mind. Or, if Dark Kingdom won the batter, would Her Majesty take 
all the shitennou back to life?<br>
The blue eyes closed, Jadeite was waiting for his doom calmly and silently.<br>
However, death disappointed him.<br>
He felt himself held in a warm, strong embrace. But before he got used to the 
warmth he was suddenly pushed away.<br>
Amazedly Jadeite opened his eyes and saw Kunzite standing with his arms folded 
in front of him. He was as cold as usual, and his still expressionless face made 
him look like a marble sculpture.<br>
&quot;I have paid what I owe you.&quot;<br>
With these worlds Kunzite turned back indifferently and left without bothering 
giving the other man a glance.<br>
In the view of the blonde, Kunzite's action was like a slow motion of a silent 
film. He thought he should have explained something to the higher-ranked man. He 
thought he should had told him that he had never blamed the silver-haired 
general; he thought he should had explained that the only reason he didn't say 
forgive to Kunzite was he had never resented him; he thought he should also had 
told Kunzite that he knew the pain of losing his lover, and he would like to 
comfort him, like a friend could do, though the older one might never need any¡­<br>
He wished he could one day tell Kunzite that may their friendship keep on, as if 
nothing had ever happened.<br>
However, before he could say anything he found himself losing all his energy, 
while the world was being swallowed by a brunch of strange pink light.<br>
He understood it was the light of the silver crystal.<br>
Just at the moment, he disappeared in the pink light, as the same thing happened 
to Kunzite.<br>
The sailor scouts went on their marching, and the dark queen summoned some other 
youma without bothered remembering her former generals, as if the shitennou had 
never appeared in the world.<br>
