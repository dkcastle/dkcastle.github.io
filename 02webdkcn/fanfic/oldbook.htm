<font face="Arial">As the highest-ranked tennou, Kunzite who was called the ice 
king by the youma privately seldom showed so gentle an expression. However no 
matter how much affection and love that he could not hide flowing in those 
silver eyes, the smiling boy he was staring did not response, even that pair of 
beautiful emerald eyes didn't moved a tiny bit.<br>
<br>
Kunzite signed before put down the photo of Zoiste and took a book of high-level 
magic from the book shell.<br>
<br>
The rose petal was still in the flyleaf, but the sense was as far as if it were 
from centuries before.<br>
<br>
The silver-haired tennou opened up a random page carefully, caressed the notes 
written on it fondly. At the beginning of the time he became the boy's mentor, 
he had given a lot of books to the younger one and guide him to read.<br>
<br>
Yet the one in his hand was the only book that he would only lend it to Zoisite 
instead of to give him. He asked Zoisite to report to him about what the boy had 
read at least once a week, he also asked the younger one to take notes on the 
book for his revising.<br>
<br>
As long as that could Kunzite see that beautiful, talent, stubborn and 
uninhibited boy once a week. Kunzite stealthily allowed himself to indulge his 
hidden selfishness, which appeared at when he hadn't realized.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, every time when he got the book back could he sense the faint 
fragment of roses, which belonged to the beautiful, graceful boy. Even the 
indistinct fragment alone was enough to fulfill the most romantic dreams of the 
highest-ranked general every lonely night.<br>
<br>
Before long had Zoisite began to sit at the desk in Kunzite's office, listen to 
his mentor explaining the knowledge in the book carefully instead of simply hand 
over his book with notes respectfully, and they sat so close that they could 
feel each other's head. But Kunzite could not remember when it began.<br>
<br>
Before long had Zoisite began to sit on Kunzite lap leaning against his 
shoulder, reading and taking notes, and at the same time discussing about the 
high-leveled magic with his mentor. But Kunzite could not remember when it 
began.<br>
<br>
The brilliant boy had made great progresses. It was within a few months had he 
finished studying the high level magic. At night of the day in which Queen 
Metallia claimed that Zoisite had passed the test and became one of the 
shitennou, the boy stayed in the bedroom of his mentor as well as lover, for the 
whole night, for his whole rest life.<br>
<br>
The notes on the old book appeared to be fading. Kunzite was back to the reality 
from memory. He closed the book and put it back carefully onto the book shell.<br>
<br>
And then he turned away, to face his last battle against the sailor scouts.<br>
