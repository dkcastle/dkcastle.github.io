<p><font face="Arial">Kunzite didn't like sweet food ever since a long time ago, 
and nobody knew that better than Zoisite. Hence , when Zoisite mentioned his 
expectation of chocolate on Valentine's Day freely, he didn't really expect that 
Kunzite would satisfy such an inessential wish for him. Even as much as Kunzite 
loves him, that powerful ice king had never cared about such holidays of human 
beings, which are usually treated as days for sales by human, nor would he ever 
remember any of them.<br>
Zoisite understood that. However, when he opened his emerald eyes finding 
himself not waking up in the embrace of Kunzite as everyday in the morning, 
Zoisite couldn't help felt a loss, even the well-prepared breakfast on the table 
didn't make him happier.<br>
When sitting at the table Zoisite found the temperature of breakfast was just 
comfortable. Obviously, Kunzite knew well about his lover, and he had prepared 
breakfast for his beloved beauty accurately. Zoisite noticed the fact, which 
made him feel better now. After all, he knew that sometimes the older man would 
have huge amount of work to do since he was the highest-ranked general, and when 
he had too much missions he might get up early himself without waken up his 
emerald-eyed lover.<br>
Yet, it is Valentine's Day! Although he couldn't help pouted, Zoisite admitted 
that the festivals of human beings usually mean nothing to the powerful 
workaholic. As a result, he tried his best to persuade himself to ignore the 
faint feeling of disappointed. After all, the youngest general also had his own 
work to do, and even one brilliant as Zoisite had to work hard though he had 
Kunzite as his mentor as well as his lover.<br>
Zoisite wondered whether he had stepped into a wrong room, or even a wrong…space 
when he was back to his room in the evening. He was taken aback by the chocolate 
overflowing his room. It was a chocolate mountain filled with the atmosphere of 
Valentine's Day! All boxes are wrapped with bright, colorful packages, and some 
of them were also tied with pink or rosy ribbons.<br>
As soon as Zoisite was standing there surprised, the ceiling-height chocolate 
mountain suddenly started to separate apart, as if being pressed by an invisible 
power from the middle. Some boxes fell down to the floor in front of him when 
moving, Zoisite picked up one of them, and saw his silver-haired love sitting at 
the table which had been once behind the chocolate mountain smiling to him.<br>
Those emerald eyes widened. However, before he could say a word Zoisite fell 
into a warm embrace. Before Zoisite noticed had Kunzite came to his lover and 
held the boy in his arms:&quot;Zoisite, all kinds of chocolate for Valentine's Day 
are here. Please help yourself.&quot;<br>
Every box of chocolate was different, and there were also different languages on 
them. Some of them had letters and words on the box, some of them were like 
tadpole symbols, and some were written in some kinds of square characters. Not 
all languages were familiar to Zoisite, but he could understand that Kunzite had 
brought any kinds of chocolate all over the world, for his wish of Valentine 
Chocolate—it was tough work even to the most powerful general, and that was why 
Kunzite had left so early in the morning.<br>
With his mind wandering Zoisite suddenly heard a voice came close to his 
ear:&quot;Zoisite, you know I don't like sweet food…&quot;the warm breath was like a 
breeze caressing the ear of the boy, and made the blush spread to the delicate 
face and neck, &quot;Hence, you take the chocolate while I have only you to take.&quot;<br>
Hearing these words the red on Zoisite's face deepened as if it was burning. The 
beautiful boy quickly unpacked a bar of chocolate and put one piece in his 
mouth. He smiled coyly before kissed the lips of the silver-haired man:&quot;Please 
help yourself, Kunzite-sama!&quot;<br>
