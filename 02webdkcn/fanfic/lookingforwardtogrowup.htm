<p><font face="Arial">Endymion patted the back of Kunzite, who was the leader of 
the royal guardians, in the meeting room:&quot;My cousin Zoisite might be a little 
capricious, but he was also a hard-working talent boy. I believe that with your 
perfect guidance he could become a powerful general as excellent as you are, 
Lord Kunzite. But please excuse his bad temper, he is still a child.&quot; Kunzite 
nodded calmly, without a word.<br>
Hence, the prince went to open the door of the meeting room and saw Zoisite 
already waiting outside summoned by His Highness just now. Those thick eyebrows 
were not at all able to hide the glittering spirit in that pair of emerald eyes. 
Kunzite felt his heart suddenly struck. The beautiful was standing as graceful 
as a prince…no, as a princess. Kunzite couldn't help thought that did He 
Highness sure that he was introducing a guy instead of a princess to his leader 
royal guardian?<br>
Even with these thoughts was Kunzite able to keep his expression stony steady as 
usual. When the new student of him as well as the cousin of the prince stepped 
forward and bowed to him politely, he slightly nodded back following the 
etiquette of meeting a royal member before answered with a still calm 
voice:&quot;Nice to meet you, Zoisite.&quot;<br>
During the following years, it was proved that Endymion's words about Zoisite 
was much more than pure affection to a younger brother. Zoisite was definitely a 
brilliant student, and his comprehension was as impressive as his hard-working. 
Perhaps he did have been more or less spoiled, but he was in fact a sensible 
child that knew very well when he could act unrestrainedly and when he should 
not.<br>
Moreover, he had a strong feeling of trust to his handsome, powerful and calm 
mentor. Zoisite kept in doubt about almost everything, but he always followed 
the orders from Kunzite, for he deeply believed that the silver-haired man would 
never do harm to him. <br>
In fact Kunzite didn't show any affection openly to Zoisite, though he was 
indeed not that cold to Zoisite in private. However Zoisite preferred to believe 
in the older one, since the facts happened were always adding evidence to his 
belief.<br>
Zoisite could sense that his feeling and mentally depending on Kunzite had gone 
too far beyond a simple teacher-student relationship. He was yearning for more 
warmth, as that the silver-haired man showed by accident to him occasionally, 
yet whenever Kunzite smiled to him affectionately while nobody else around, 
Zoisite couldn't help remembered that when he first met Kunzite, the prince 
introduced: &quot;He is still a child.&quot;<br>
Kunzite-sama was simply doting on a child. Such thought made Zoisite feel 
disappointed, however he dared not to express his secret to anyone. The only 
thing he was looking forward to was to grow up, to be grown enough to stand by 
Kunzite's side.<br>
Not until one day had Zoisite gathered all his courage and asked his mentor 
whether he saw him as a child.<br>
The emerald eyes was trying to get avoid of the silver sights, yet Kunzite was 
able to catch a bunch of adoring sense escaping from those beautiful emerald 
eyes. The strong and warm hands gently covered the slender shoulders:&quot;I am 
willing to wait for you to grow up, Zoisite, though I had never seen you as a 
child from the beginning.&quot;<br>
Bright smile bloomed on the delicate face of the beauty, and the shining smile 
melted the consisting ice in those silver eyes.<br>
At the night of Zoisite's sixteenth birthday, Kunzite took Zoisite to his own 
room. And the rose in bud was eventually blooming charmingly in the embrace of 
the ice and snow.<br>
