<p><font face="Arial">My name is Metallia.<br>
I don¡¯t know why I have such a name, nor do I know who gave me the name. It 
happened too early before, even earlier than ever.<br>
When I was born in the endless chaos in darkness, I left my sisters and 
brothers, and led my way alone to seeking and absorbing the energy, which were 
my nature as well as my fate.<br>
I chose the earth, and I chose human beings, for their energy was full and 
extremely easy to get, comparing with other species.<br>
You are right, I killed. To absorb energy also means to destroy lives, since 
those who lost their energy would end up as mummifications.<br>
As a result, those sailor brats who were more powerful than moral defined me as 
the demon of the hell. How preposterous they were, did they really mean the 
so-called ¡°justice¡±?<br>
It is true that I killed, I ate. I was neither sacred nor great. I was no more 
than a plain life, and I was living a private life since billions of years ago, 
my only propose was to live on.<br>
It is naturally the same as the sailor scouts, isn¡¯t it? Had they and the human 
under their protection ever recognized that they were also killing and eating 
numerous lives when they were having meals? For these lives, could they keep 
claiming that they were senshi of love and justice?!<br>
No, they had never got that qualification to blame me. It is fair for them to 
claim themselves ¡°senshi of love and justice¡± while identify me as ¡°demon from 
the hell¡± if only limit the identification within the human being, which in only 
one single species among the grand, endless universe.<br>
In fact, we are the same, equal in born and equal in death. Plants and animals 
get energy from object in some particular path ways, while I was evolved enough 
to absorb pure energy directly. All roads lead to Rome, obeying the first rule 
go through the whole universe, of which we are all creatures.<br>
It¡¯s a pity that the sailor brats would never listen to my reasons. After all, 
the jungle justice is another rule of the universe, same as the rule of life for 
life.<br>
The sailor brats were a group with numerous unions, while I, unfortunately, a 
single one. Hence, it was my doom to lose to them.<br>
However knowing the doom didn¡¯t lead me to give up. I evaded the expected war 
and hid myself in the sun, at a secret moment.<br>
The brighter the light is, the stronger the shadow will be. That young star was 
bright enough to hide me in, but I was not escaping, instead, I was simply 
waiting for my chance. If those sailor scouts could have their unions, why 
couldn¡¯t I have some? And if I got my own union, I could not only win the battle 
but also gain the sailor crystals, which meant precious energy of life! My 
desire to the crystals was as strong as the morals¡¯ to wealth.<br>
Time passed slowly, almost too slow for me to keep patience. In the end, I 
sensed a woman, who had desire to the crystals as I did, and hated the sailor 
scouts as I did as well. As a result, I went back to the earth in the drawn with 
meteor shower, to the woman calling my name. We became a union, before gathered 
some other human beings at our side¡ªdon¡¯t be surprise, since the human could 
domesticate some animals, keep them as pets or even killers while eating up some 
other animals, why couldn¡¯t I do the similar thing to the human beings? Is there 
any differences in nature?<br>
We founded a new empire, for countering the sailor scouts.<br>
Then started the battle.<br>
We were not the week, and we did have perfect plans¡ªalmost perfect. The sailor 
scouts were too powerful for me to escape the doom.<br>
As you had expected, the sailor brats beat me and killed my unions, but they 
could never destroy me. The darkness would never be destroyed if only the light 
exists. In fact, even though light disappears darkness is still eternal. Since I 
belong to the darkness, I would be exist in the eternal darkness¡­how wonderful! 
Hence, the sailor scouts paid their own lives as the price, only for my silence 
for an instance.<br>
Perhaps they had forgot the third rule of the universe: the recycle of the 
elements, and the conservation of the matter.<br>
Hence, I waited under the ground, as patient and silent as I had done before. I 
believed in the basic rules of the universe, which means that the power that 
concealing me would sooner or later weakened even disappeared, and my unions 
would one day be revived and came to me again.<br>
My thought was proved by the truth. It was not a waste of time and I witnessed 
the revival of my unions.<br>
The battle started before long. We lost again although we tried even harder than 
the previous time. I would not blame the others, the only thing to be blamed was 
that my mistake to trust the human, while they were the least trustable 
creature.<br>
When the blade trusted through my forehead, I sensed the sense of death for the 
first time during my life. I head the sailor brats claiming: They won because 
they were fighting for justice, while I lost because I stand for evil.<br>
What idiots, they had never understood the truth, neither had they ever correct 
their mistake in logic. In fact, I lost so I stand for evil, while they were 
believed to stand for justice because they had won the battle.<br>
Not to mention, the history was always written by the winners, and that¡¯s why 
the justice always defeats the evil, whoever the winner was.<br>
But what about you? Am I really destroyed as they claimed? Thing it carefully, 
since it¡¯s rather important to you, to me, to everyone, every creature.<br>
