<p><font face="Arial">The night was as dark as usual. The darkness had me, but 
the stars twinkling in the sky shined my mind. My Nephrite-sama, I am here. Are 
you staring at me with your deep, gentle blue starry eyes? I know you must be 
looking at me, you glanced at my happiness, you glanced at my sadness. We were 
separated by the fate, but I know you had never left me.<br>
That night was like a nightmare, in the nightmare I held your body trembling 
with tears on my face. I caressed your still-warm face covered with blood, I 
heard those merciless ridicule that broke my heart, I was sad and furious, by 
completely helpless. It was like a long-expected exciting celebration of your 
enemies…I struggled and cried, begged to the god not to take you away from me, 
but I gain no pity at all…<br>
The dark green blood on the orange cloth had dried, it was once tied on your 
arm, and it is tied on my heart for the whole life. For how many times I thought 
you were still standing behind the purple curtain of my room when woke up from 
nightmares with tears? Yet whenever I opened the curtain it was only the sound 
of wind answering to me…<br>
You want me to live on, you wish me a happy life, so that your sacrifice would 
be meaningful, but do you ever know, dear Nephrite? At the moment you left me 
all happiness left me, how could there be any possibility for me to fall in love 
with anyone else?<br>
If you wish(tears)…if you really wish that(sobbing)…I will make it true…I 
promise to you it would come true…<br>
Do you feel lonely in the other world, my dear Nephrite-sama? Was there anyone 
listening to your story? Was there anyone being with you and taking care of you? 
I'm telling you that tomorrow will be a special day, because my wedding would be 
on tomorrow, yes…I was getting married, were you happy for that? Nephrite-sama? 
If you feel a lost and sadness besides your sense of happiness, please trust me 
that you are still my only love. I might be the wife and mother of someone else, 
but please trust me that you are the only man in my heart, you are the only man 
I am loving and have ever loved…<br>

How time flies, Nephrite-sama! In the slight rain of drawn I walked into this 
forest again, and the forest that was so familiar to me is in a silent. I went 
to the tree under which you had once left, and tied a yellow ribbon on a wet 
brunch of the tree. I prayed with my both hands in front of my chest, I prayed 
for your happiness in the other world…I sat down on the ground and leaned 
against the tree, caressing the grassland affectionately on which you had once 
sat. The two pieces of chocolate parfait was melting, as if even they could 
sense my sorrow…my thoughts flew…<br>
&quot;Shu-&quot; I looked up when I heard the voice, it was the yellow ribbons floating in 
the breeze dancing with rain drops. Are you there, Nephrite-sama?<br>
Oh, my dearest Nephrite, how are you in the moment? In so many years I dedicated 
anything a woman could do for her family, such as my youth, work, time and 
energy…such dedication more or less made me feel better…made me less painful 
because of my love to you. In the silent night I had again and again opened the 
love letter you gave me. Although you wrote that in the name of someone else as 
a plot at the moment, I remember the past of us whenever I read it once more.<br>
It was like yesterday once more…the time flash back to the gorgeous party…you 
were like a dream and I was devoting in the dream world you created, although 
you were devil and making use of me at that moment.<br>
&quot;Nephrite…&quot; What a warm and familiar name, when I called your name again with 
you in my mind, I was not that sad and sorrow as before, because you had became 
part of me, you had been in my soul, in my life, in my heart for the eternity.<br>
Nephrite…this might be my last time to the forest in the park, the ground of 
autumn was covered with golden leaves, and I raised my head to enjoy the warm 
sunshine staring at the yellow ribbons covering the brunches of the tree. I felt 
satisfied while my eyes wet…I had wrote my will, when I was alive I have 
responsibility to my family, but after my death I wish my children would pour my 
bone ash here in the forest, in the ground beyond which yellow ribbons floating 
in the wind, so that I could be with you forever…<br>
&quot;Wow, it's so beautiful!&quot; A lovely little boy was surprised when running towards 
me, followed by his young mother.<br>
&quot;Granny, are these yellow ribbons yours?&quot; The boy asked with his innocent eyes 
widened.<br>
&quot;Of course, they are for a dead family member of me.&quot; I answered with kindly.<br>
&quot;Why are there so many, granny?&quot;<br>
I turned around, staring at the flowing yellow ribbons with affectionate 
smile:&quot;Because granny wishes to meet him in another day in the paradise!&quot;<br>
~O~<br>
