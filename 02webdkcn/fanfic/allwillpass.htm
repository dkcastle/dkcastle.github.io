<p><font face="Arial">It was a sunny day, in which the flag of the Elysium 
Kingdom fluttering under the sun in the morning. In the shining glory of the 
flag, a silver-haired young man went down on his one knee in front of a 
dark-haired man, offering his sword for giving his loyalty and courage to his 
prince.<br>
&quot;I, Kunzite, swear to be loyal to Prince Endymion of the Elysium Kingdom. I 
promise my respect, my love and esteem to him; I promise to protect him until 
death.&quot;<br>
Prince Endymion bowed slightly to Kunzite, pushed his hands onto the sword, his 
face looked still like a child while his expression was serious.<br>
&quot;I, Endymion, prince of the kingdom of Elysium, accept the loyalty from Lord 
Kunzite. I promise my respect, my confidence and my glory to him; I promise to 
trust him until death.&quot;<br>
The silver eyes kept icy cool. Every man of Elysium devoted their loyalty to the 
royal family by offering their swords, but such a serious rite was not for 
everyone. Only the four royal guardians who were the four high-ranked generals 
as well had the glory of such a rite, and Kunzite was the leader of the 
guardian, the first-ranked general.<br>
Millions of people worshipped him, but Kunzite didn't lose his usual calmness in 
the extreme fame. Perhaps not everything was just like what they appeared to be, 
yet the cool, expressionless silver-haired general was used to be loyal and 
subordinating.<br>
Every time when training new guardians, Kunzite started with a non-magic 
fighting. Nobody could overpower him, but what really annoyed him was that all 
the young men were yes-men that all they did was lowered their heads waiting for 
a lesson.<br>
Until one day.<br>
Until one day prince Endymion took a pretty boy to him telling him that was the 
new guardian Zoisite, who as talent and gifted, and the only distance between 
Zoisite and perfect was as long as a few academic training.<br>
When Kunzite found the copper-haired boy tried to attack him with the pink petal 
blade, he admitted that he felt a sense of admiring in the feeling of surprise. 
However, that was not because how skillful the boy was in the using of attacking 
magic.<br>
After waved his cape to make the petals disappeared, Kunzite asked:&quot;Zoisite, 
haven't I told you that it is a non-magic fight?&quot;<br>
The emerald eyes were bright and stubborn:&quot;But Kunzite-sama, isn't victory the 
only goal of a fight? The fame of knight was only for acting in the arena, and 
the enemies would never bow before attacking.&quot;<br>
Kunzite kept his calmness expressionlessly, but the icy heart was like burnt in 
fire. The silver eyes met the emerald ones, and Kunzite knew that he saw 
brilliance, thoughts and freewill. For himself all these had passed, but in his 
soul, as well as that of Zoisite, all would never fade.<br>
