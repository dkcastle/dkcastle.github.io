<p><font face="Arial">It was already late when Zoisite was aware of his teacher 
Kunzite stepping nearby. He tried to hide the book he was reading behind him, 
but he failed, Kunzite grabbed the book in his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh? Zoisite, I never knew that I have a student who likes reading yaoi 
stories.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zoisite lowered his head and dare not to speak. He feared that Kunzite would 
know him being a gay. However, Kunzite suddenly kissed the boy's lips: &quot;I've 
taught you long before, Zoisite, books are far less than enough, you need to 
practice.&quot;<br>
